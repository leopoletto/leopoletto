## Hi there 👋

I’m a technologist focused on the intersection of web standards, accessibility, performance, privacy, and digital ethics.

As the founder of [WizardCompass](https://github.com/wizardcompass), I lead the design and development of tools that transform complex technical audits into actionable insights. My work is rooted in research and driven by purpose — helping developers, designers, and digital teams build ethical, performant, and compliant web experiences.

Over the years, I’ve shifted from building websites and systems to questioning how we build them — and why. Today, I focus on creating scalable foundations that promote transparency, accessibility, and user respect by default.


## 🔍 Areas of focus:

- Accessibility Audits & Compliance (WCAG, ARIA, assistive tech)
- Privacy & Security Headers, Data Ethics (CSP, DNT, GDPR)
- Web Performance, Lighthouse, and Core Web Vitals
- Research & Development of internal tools and methodologies
- Developer Education and Documentation Strategy

<br />

Whether it’s refining HTML semantics, debugging a CSP violation, or guiding a team toward more ethical digital decisions, I bring the same level of curiosity, depth, and care.

"Let’s build the web — better."
