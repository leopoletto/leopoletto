# Leonardo Poletto

Software Engineer focused on building **reliable systems under real-world constraints**.

I work across backend, frontend, and platform layers, with a strong emphasis on:

- system correctness and data integrity  
- performance, scalability, and predictable behavior  
- web standards, privacy, and automation  
- evolving legacy systems without breaking production  

Most repositories here are **tools, experiments, and reference implementations** extracted from real production work — built to solve concrete problems, not demos.

## What you’ll find here

### Open-Source Contributions (Upstream)

I contribute directly to widely used open-source projects when production work exposes gaps in correctness, documentation, or real-world behavior.

These are **upstream contributions**, not forks or experiments.

Selected examples:

- **Tighten / Jigsaw**  
  Authored the core implementation for allowing collections to be defined via functions  
  → https://github.com/tighten/jigsaw/pull/686  
  (Code authored by me; styling and tests were later added by maintainers before merge.)

- **PHP.net**  
  Fixed responsiveness and accessibility issues in syntax highlighting across the documentation site  
  → https://github.com/php/web-php/pull/777  

- **Spatie / laravel-csp**  
  Contributed fixes and improvements to Content Security Policy enforcement  
  → https://github.com/spatie/laravel-csp/pull/178  

- **Google Chrome / Lighthouse**  
  Contributed fixes identified through real-world auditing workflows  
  → https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16665  

- **Google / robotstxt (C++)**  
  Authored documentation and behavior corrections to align CLI output with actual parser behavior  
  → https://github.com/google/robotstxt/pull/78 (pending merge)

These contributions are driven by production needs, not academic exercises.

### Authored Tools & Libraries

Projects here are **original work**, not forks:

- **Robots.txt parsing & analysis**
  - https://github.com/leopoletto/robots-txt-parser  
    PHP library for parsing and analyzing robots.txt files, designed for auditability and scripting use cases.

- **Privacy & request inspection**
  - https://github.com/leopoletto/chrome-privacy-extension  
    Chrome extension for inspecting request behavior, privacy signals, and third-party tracking patterns.

- **Font tooling & analysis**
  - https://github.com/leopoletto/font-self-host  
    Self-hosting pipelines
  - https://github.com/leopoletto/font-lint-python-scripts  
    Font metadata extraction, Unicode coverage analysis, and fallback auditing
  - Built to support production typography decisions, not visual demos

### Automation & Systems Work

Across repositories you’ll see:

- CLI tools and batch pipelines for crawling, analysis, and large-scale processing  
- Node.js, PHP, Python, and shell-based workflows  
- Practical approaches to:
  - concurrency control  
  - async processing  
  - caching and idempotency  
  - predictable failure handling

## How I work

I’m most effective in environments where:

- requirements are messy and constraints are real  
- systems must stay online while they evolve  
- correctness matters as much as speed  
- ownership is expected, not assigned  

I value clarity, boring reliability, and shipping things that last.
