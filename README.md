## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Senior Full-Stack Engineer who builds production-ready applications and automation tools across Node.js and PHP ecosystems, combining backend services, browser automation, and system-level scripting.

Over the last several years, Iâ€™ve:
- Delivered full-stack web apps with `Laravel`, `Vue`, and modern `JS` pipelines.
- Built automation tooling with Node.js, Puppeteer, and Commander.js â€” everything from data extraction to site performance auditing.
- Engineered performance workflows that measure Core Web Vitals, enforce CSP/SRI security, and optimize web fonts.
- Wrapped Googleâ€™s production `C++` `robots.txt` parser in Node.js for high-accuracy crawl compliance.
- Created Chrome extensions for privacy and request monitoring.

Beyond shipping code, Iâ€™ve launched Wizard Compass, an educational initiative that turns Chrome Lighthouse audits into interactive lessons. My goal is to make complex performance, accessibility, and security concepts understandable and actionable for developers of all levels.

I thrive in roles where I can solve hard technical problems, mentor others, and deliver measurable improvements to reliability, speed, and security.

Tech stack: `Node.js`, `Puppeteer`, `Commander.js`, `p-limit`, `Laravel`, `Vue.js`, `MySQL`, `Redis`, `Docker`, `GitHub Actions`, `Bash/Unix (jq, yq)`, `Chrome Extension APIs`, `Lighthouse`.
