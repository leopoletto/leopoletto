## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I build production-ready applications and automation tools across Node.js and PHP stacks, combining backend services, browser automation, and system-level scripting.

Highlights:

- Node.js Automation: CLI tools with Commander.js, p-limit, and Unix utilities (jq, yq) for fast, reliable, dependency-light pipelines.

- Browser Engineering: Puppeteer scripts for site data extraction, CSP/SRI checks, font performance, and automated Lighthouse audits.

- Chrome Extensions: Privacy monitoring tools with real-time request inspection and configurable blocking.

- High-Accuracy Integrations: Googleâ€™s C++ robots.txt parser wrapped in Node.js for precise crawl workflows.

- I solve problems across full-stack, automation, and performance tooling â€” delivering faster, lighter, and reliable solutions that many JS developers donâ€™t touch.

Tech Stack:
Node.js, Puppeteer, Commander.js, p-limit, Chrome Extensions, Lighthouse, Laravel, Vue.js, MySQL, Redis, Docker, GitHub Actions, Bash/Unix tools (jq, yq)
